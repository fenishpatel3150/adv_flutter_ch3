<h2 align = "center"> <i> 1. connectivity_plus package </i> </h2>

The connectivity_plus package in Flutter is a community-maintained plugin that provides a way to access the network connectivity status of a device. This package allows developers to determine if the device is connected to a network and the type of network (Wi-Fi, mobile data, etc.) it's connected to. It's an enhanced version of the original connectivity package, adding new features and improvements based on community feedback.
